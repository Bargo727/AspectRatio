# AspectRatio
This repository contains all code used to output figures pertaining to the lattice model in the paper "Using Cell Shape to Control Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Synthetic Microbial Consortia".  The name of each file corresponds to the figure in the paper for which the indicated code was used to produce.  All are coded in MATLAB.

#fig5 contains files used to produce figure 5 in the main paper.  fig3ab.m is used to produce the time series snapshots of invasion and bulk displacement mechanisms in the lattice model.  Read the commentary in the code.  You can modify the initial conditions of the code by uncommenting appropriate code lines.  fig3c.m is used to produce the average strain fraction dynamics.  Again, uncomment the appropriate code to obtain results for bulk displacement or invasion.
